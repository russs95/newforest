<h1>New Forest Aquaponics</h1> <h2>Towards Transition through Aquaponics & Ecobricks</h2>

<p>Dave & Lucie run New Forest Aquaponics Community Interest Company as a regenerative contribution to the biosphere, our community & people</p>

<div class="emoji">🐟</div><h3>Our History</h3>
<p>Our love of aquaponics grew from our love of plants and fish. 

<p>After going through some tough times as a family we realised that families like ours need a place to recover and learn. We began to formulate our ideas.</p>

<div class="emoji">🐠</div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>

<p>We aim to provide a rounded, regenerative community that people can replicate across the UK. </p>

<p>This will include the growing of food, ecobricks and all the connections between.</p>

<p>We aim to be working examples of aquaponics and ecobricks benefitting communites.</p>

<h3>Who we are<br></h3>

<p>New Forest Aquaponics is the idea of David Green & Lucie Mann. David is a trained fish farmer and has worked with many species of fish over his 30-year career. Lucie loves to grow and make things.</p>


<p>Having seen the problems caused by poor farming - lack of nutrients in our food - lack of quality and freshness - plastic packing - high prices - environmentally and money wise we want to do something about it!</p>

<p>💚 💚 💚</p>

<p>To do this we are using our skills to develop the first aquaponics farm in the New Forest (south UK.) - We have been working at our site for the last few years, and we have a huge amount of equipment (recycled of course), but it is looking like we have to move very soon. This means we will need financial support to find our long term home for our aquaponics farm. You can read more about this in our Working Ethos document, and find out how you can help. </p>
 
<p>We are a Non Profit Community Interest Company (CIC), that will invest all money made back to the project.</p>

<p>As community is an important part of any farm we want to share the journey with others, why not see what part of this journey you can join us on? There is always something to do, and it is not always do do with growing food, we may just suprise you with the tasks that need doing :-) ..</p>

<p> In todays world so many of us need help and space to heal in one way or another. Healing happens with good food, a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, and of being valued for the contrubution we can bring to the world.
The experiances we have been through have shown us just how important this is, with a secure base to work from so we can really bring healing to our local community</p>

<h3>Regenerative</h3>

<p>Raising consciousness around food, community growth, and harmonious living within our biosphere. Starting with the children, these will focus around the aquaponic growing of edibles, with different programmes aimed at the target audience to focus learning and healing, whilst working together to raise awareness of environmental issues.</p>

<h3>The Watercress Queen</h3>

<p> This is Lucie's online persona. Why? Because she grows the watercress and eats lots of it!  You can find her on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/newforestaquaponics/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/watercress_queen" target="_blank"</a>Instagram,<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/WatercressQueen/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/watercressqueen" target="_blank">Twitter</a> under that name.  Links to all are at the bottom of each webpage 
where you will find regular updates on them.</p>

<h3>Aquaponics</h3>

<p>Aquaponics is the cultivation of plants in water that with aquatic organisms. Basically, fish provide organic fertilizer for the plants and the plants help clean the water for the fish! Aquaponics is our main focus. We need a long term home for New Forest Aquaponics so we can start aquaponic farming with co workers and volunteers, and really do our work!.</p>

<h3>Ecobricks</h3>

<p>We are very passionate about helping everyone to rediscover a more connected way of living, respecting our biosphere. As part of this, we have started working with ecobricks. Lucie and her son Robbie have trained as Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) Ecobrick trainers. They give talks and run workshops on how to reduce your plastic. Once we have our new home we will be able to build and help inspire people to use ecobricks within and for the benifit of their communities. </p>

<p>Working with the Global Ecobrick Alliance to educate about plastic and how we can change our attitude to its value within society. </p>

<p>Holding workshops on ecobricks and building with cob, getting more and more ecobrick trainers into communities.
